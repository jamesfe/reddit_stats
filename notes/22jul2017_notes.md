# Notes 22 Jul 2017

## Todays Work

- Clean up the code some
- Add some configuration stuff to make it easier to run the program
- Begin a new branch on finding the longevity of a poster

## After-Action Review

- Testing is pretty easy in a statically typed language
- Writing tests is, however, a little boring when you are so far behind
- Golang really loves their interfaces, which means mocking and filesystem tests are tough
- I should learn more about these magical interfaces :-)

- I did not end up working on longevity stuff so I will do a bit more of that but may not post till tomorrow.
