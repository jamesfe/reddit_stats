# Random Sample

We need to randomly sample all the subreddits to figure out if there are a lot of deleted comments or not.  For this I think I will sample about .25% of all the comments which should be roughly 325,000,000 comments.  I'll do this by adding a new function similar to "isDonaldLite" and just dump that into my functional check, then I'll refactor later.
